    <h2><p>This is a short recipe provided to a collective cookbook given to a 
        dear friend from all the guests of the wedding. It is a delicious recipe
        for Nepali style veg momos which are a popular snack or quick meal 
        in Nepal.</p>
        <p>I added this recipe because I had lived in Nepal before and 
            wanted to share something from my life to add to her list. We had also made 
        momos together when Irene and Georges were living in Thailand together. </p>
